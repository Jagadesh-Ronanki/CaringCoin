# Project: CaringCoin
**CaringCoin** is a blockchain-based platform that allows you to showcase your skills and creativity in a game-like environment. By creating content similar to a social media platform, you can advance through different levels, earning progressively higher amounts of appreciation for your contributions.

## Problem statement
We noticed that many people have unique talents and skills that they wish to showcase in public. However, it's not easy to get noticed, and there are very few platforms that actively incentivize contribution. We wanted to make a platform where anyone can be recognized for their skills and creativity.

## Solution
Our solution is a platform where users can create various forms of content, such as art, writing, and more. By giving appreciation to their content, other users can earn CaringCoins, which they can exchange for other crypto assets. Users can continue earning higher amounts of appreciation as they progress through the levels, earning a higher percentage of other users' appreciation with each level.

### Technologies
CaringCoin is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, providing a secure and decentralized platform. Our frontend is developed using React/Next, allowing for a flexible and user-friendly interface. For smart contract development, we use Solidity, a widely-used language for blockchain-based contracts.

To convert various crypto assets into dollar amounts, we rely on Chainlink price feeds, which provide accurate and reliable conversion values.

### Dependencies
Users interested in using CaringCoin will need to have a compatible Ethereum wallet installed on their device.

Here's an example scenario of a user starting at level 0 and leveling up to level 1, with a withdrawal limit of 50 dollars and 10% of the amount being considered as a contributable amount to support other users:

    User A signs up for CaringCoin and starts at level 0, with an appreciation amount of $1.

    User A creates a piece of content and shares it with the community. Other users appreciate the content by giving User A cryptocurrency, which increases their appreciation amount.

    After earning enough appreciation, User A levels up to level 1. Their withdrawal limit is now set to $50.

    User A decides to withdraw $50 of their earned cryptocurrency. Of the $50, 10% ($5) is considered as a contributable amount to support other users.

    User A receives the remaining $45 in their wallet and can use it for various purposes.
